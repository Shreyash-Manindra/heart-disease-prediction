❤️‍🩹 Heart Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning & Synthetic Data Augmentation

Patent Pending — Do Not Distribute Without Authorization

Overview

This repository contains a machine-learning framework designed to improve heart-disease risk prediction through the integration of synthetic data augmentation techniques. The system enhances predictive performance, robustness, and generalizability, especially in scenarios with imbalanced or limited medical datasets.

The methodology used in this project is currently under review as part of a potential patent filing, and therefore no proprietary algorithms, parameter sets, or unpublished techniques are disclosed in this README.

🔬 Key Features

Synthetic Data Augmentation Pipeline
Incorporates a controlled synthetic-data generation process designed to improve class balance and expand the feature distribution in clinically realistic ways.

Machine Learning Model for Cardiovascular Risk Prediction
Implements a supervised classification model trained on both real and augmented datasets to improve sensitivity, specificity, and overall diagnostic reliability.

Evaluation Across Multiple Metrics
Includes accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, ROC-AUC, and confusion-matrix visualization.

Secure & Reproducible Workflow
All code is modularized for research reproducibility while keeping proprietary augmentation logic protected.

⚠️ Intellectual Property Notice

This project contains concepts, methodologies, and workflows that are part of an ongoing patent application.
As such:

Redistribution is prohibited without written permission.

Proprietary portions of the synthetic augmentation pipeline have been removed or abstracted from this repository for IP protection.

Any derivative work must not implement or attempt to reconstruct the protected augmentation methodology.

🧠 Project Motivation

Traditional medical datasets—especially heart-disease datasets—often suffer from:

Class imbalance

Small sample sizes

Limited demographic diversity

Missing or noisy data

These limitations can cause ML models to overfit or underperform in real clinical settings.
Synthetic augmentation aims to expand the clinical representativeness of the data while maintaining medically plausible patterns.




Note: Certain modules or functions may be intentionally omitted due to patent restrictions.
